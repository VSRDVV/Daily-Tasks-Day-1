Differences between browser JS and Node JS:

Some of the basic differences between browser JS and Node JS are as below:

1) Java Script is a scripting language.
	Node JS is a standalone enivrioment for executing JavaScript code without the help of a browser.

2) Browser JS can be executed only on the browsers using the java script engine present in the browser.
It is browser dependent for execution.
	Node JS environment is developed by Ryan Dahl by downloading the code of java script engine and 
added few more features to enable it as a stand alone environment.It is browser independent.

3)Browser JS can process HTML tags and also DOMs.
	In Node JS HTML tags cannot be added.

4)Browser JS is mostly used in the client side.
	Node Js is mostly used on the server side.

5)Javascript runs on multiple engines liek Spide Monkey,V8,Java Script Coreetc.
	Node JS only supports V8 engine.
