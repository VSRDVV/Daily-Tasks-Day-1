HTTP1.1 VS HTTP 1.2:

HTTP 1.1:It keeps all the requests and responses
in plain text format.

	HTTP 1.2: It uses binary framing to convert 
		all messages into binary foramt.

HTTP 1.1 : It loads resources one after other.
If one resource is blocked later ones are blocked too.

	HTTP 1.2 : All the resources are sent in multiple streams.
		So there is no blocking of resources here.

HTTP 1.1 : There is no active server push mechanism in HTTP1.1

	HTTP1.2: A server only serves content to a client device if the 
	client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern 
	webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.

HTTP 1.1 : Small files are executed faster than larger ones.
Compression techniques used in HTTP 1.1 
are less effective than the ones used in HTTP 1.2.

	HTTP 1.2 The compression technique used here is much more
	effective than the methodology used in HTTP 1.1.
